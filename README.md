# RPS-Multiplayer-Train

In this application, the user is able to make a live train schedule by inputting the name of a train, the train's destination, start time, and frequency. This information is then stored in firebase and used to display the train's name, destination, frequency, next arrival and number of minutes away, thus keeping the site accurately displayed with all of the trains' schedules each time a user visits the site. Moment.js is used to manipulate the time data.

#Required to Use: A firebase API key is required to use this application.
